## Pipeline Configuration Overview

The pipeline configuration is defined in a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file placed at the root of your repository. This file contains all the instructions for running the CI/CD pipeline.

---

## Pipeline Sections

### **1. Stages**
Defines the order of execution for jobs.

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy
```

- **Execution Order:** Jobs in the `build` stage run first, followed by `test`, then `deploy`.
- **Best Practices:** Use logical stages for better readability and organization.

---

### **2. Jobs**
Jobs define individual tasks within a pipeline.

#### Example:
```yaml
build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the application..."
```

- **Attributes:**
  - `stage:` Specifies the stage.
  - `script:` Commands to execute.
  - `tags:` Restrict to specific runners.
  - `only:`/`except:` Define conditions.
  - `artifacts:` Preserve outputs.
  - `retry:` Define retries on failure.

---

### **3. Script**
Lists shell commands executed sequentially in a job.

```yaml
test-job:
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm test
```

- **Best Practices:**
  - Ensure each command exits correctly to prevent job failures.
  - Use scripts to automate tasks like testing, building, and deploying.

---

### **4. Variables**
Defines custom environment variables. Variables can be global or scoped to specific jobs.

#### Global Variables:
```yaml
variables:
  NODE_ENV: production
  DEBUG_MODE: "false"
```

#### Job-Specific Variables:
```yaml
build-job:
  variables:
    BUILD_ENV: production
  script:
    - echo $BUILD_ENV
```

- **Use Cases:**
  - Pass credentials or configuration.
  - Customize behavior dynamically.

---

### **5. Cache**
Specifies directories to cache between pipeline runs to improve efficiency.

```yaml
cache:
  paths:
    - node_modules/
    - .m2/repository/
```

- **Use Cases:**
  - Cache dependencies (e.g., `node_modules`).
  - Avoid redundant downloads.

---

### **6. Artifacts**
Preserves job outputs for later stages or review.  

#### Basic Example:
```yaml
artifacts:
  paths:
    - build/
  expire_in: 1 week
```

- **Attributes:**
  - `paths:` Files or directories to save.
  - `expire_in:` Specify how long artifacts are retained.
  - `reports:` Store coverage, performance, or JUnit test reports.

---

### **7. Dependencies**
Defines the jobs whose artifacts a job depends on.

```yaml
test-job:
  stage: test
  dependencies:
    - build-job
```

- **Use Case:** Ensure required files are available in later stages.

---

### **8. Rules**
Defines conditional logic for when jobs should run.

```yaml
rules:
  - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"'
  - changes:
      - src/**/*
```

- **Flexible Conditions:**
  - Trigger jobs based on branch names, files changed, or variables.
  - Combine multiple rules for complex behavior.

---

### **9. Only and Except**
Restrict job execution to specific branches, tags, or pipelines.

#### `only` Example:
```yaml
only:
  - main
  - tags
```

#### `except` Example:
```yaml
except:
  - docs/*
```

- **Best Practices:** Replace `only/except` with `rules` for advanced control.

---

### **10. Include**
Imports configuration from other `.yml` files.

```yaml
include:
  - local: 'templates/.gitlab-ci-build.yml'
```

- **Use Case:** Share common configurations across projects.

---

### **11. Extends**
Inherits configuration from another job.

```yaml
.base-job:
  script:
    - echo "Base job"

child-job:
  extends: .base-job
```

- **Benefits:** Reuse configurations and reduce duplication.

---

### **12. Before_Script and After_Script**
Runs commands before or after the `script` section.

```yaml
before_script:
  - echo "Setting up environment..."

after_script:
  - echo "Cleaning up..."
```

- **Use Case:** Install dependencies or clean up after execution.

---

### **13. Retry**
Retries a job on failure.

```yaml
retry:
  max: 3
```

- **Use Case:** Handle transient errors (e.g., network timeouts).

---

### **14. Timeouts**
Specifies a maximum execution time for jobs.

```yaml
timeout: 30m
```

- **Default:** 1 hour.
- **Best Practice:** Set appropriate timeouts to avoid hanging jobs.

---

### **15. Services**
Defines additional Docker services (e.g., databases).

```yaml
services:
  - postgres:latest
```

- **Use Case:** Enable integration tests with external dependencies.

---

### **16. Image**
Specifies a Docker image for job execution.

```yaml
image: node:16
```

- **Use Case:** Standardize environments for consistent builds.

---

### **17. Tags**
Assigns runners based on tags.

```yaml
tags:
  - production
```

- **Use Case:** Use specific runners for jobs (e.g., GPU-based, high-memory).

---

### **18. Parallel**
Runs multiple instances of a job in parallel.

```yaml
parallel:
  matrix:
    - TEST_ENV: [node16, node18]
```

- **Use Case:** Test across environments or configurations.

---

### **19. Trigger**
Triggers downstream pipelines or projects.

```yaml
trigger:
  project: group/project
  branch: main
```

- **Use Case:** Orchestrate multi-repository workflows.

---

### **20. When**
Specifies when jobs should run (`on_success`, `on_failure`, or `always`).

```yaml
when: on_failure
```

- **Use Case:** Execute cleanup tasks on failure.

---

### **21. Needs**
Defines a jobâ€™s dependencies, enabling jobs to run out of stage order.

# Branching Concepts in GitLab CI/CD

GitLab's branching model is a crucial part of managing workflows in CI/CD pipelines. This guide dives into various concepts related to branches and their configurations to help streamline your development process.

---

## Table of Contents
1. [Branch Types](#1-branch-types)
2. [Default Branch](#2-default-branch)
3. [Feature Branching](#3-feature-branching)
4. [Protected Branches](#4-protected-branches)
5. [Merge Strategies](#5-merge-strategies)
6. [Branch Rules](#6-branch-rules)

---

## 1. Branch Types
GitLab allows flexible workflows by supporting different types of branches:

### **Main Branch**
- Represents the latest stable version of your code.
- Typically used for production releases.

### **Feature Branches**
- Created for developing specific features.
- Example: `feature/add-login`.

### **Release Branches**
- Used for preparing a release.
- Example: `release/1.0.0`.

### **Hotfix Branches**
- Used to fix critical issues in production.
- Example: `hotfix/urgent-bug`.

### **Topic Branches**
- Short-lived branches created for tasks like fixing a minor bug or trying experimental changes.

---

## 2. Default Branch
The default branch is the primary branch in a GitLab repository, typically named `main` or `master`.

### Key Characteristics:
- New commits are pushed here by default.
- The base branch for pull requests or merge requests.
- The default branch is protected by default in most workflows.

### Configuring the Default Branch:
Navigate to **Settings > Repository** and set your preferred default branch.

---

## 3. Feature Branching
Feature branching is a workflow where each feature is developed in its branch.

### Workflow:
1. Create a new branch from the default branch.
2. Develop the feature.
3. Open a merge request to merge changes back into the default branch.

### Example:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-login
```

### Advantages:
- Isolated development environment for each feature.
- Clear separation of concerns.

---

## 4. Protected Branches
Protected branches restrict who can push, merge, or delete them.

### Configuring Protected Branches:
1. Go to **Settings > Repository > Protected Branches**.
2. Add the branch name (e.g., `main`).
3. Define rules for who can push, merge, or manage.

### Use Cases:
- Prevent accidental force pushes or deletions.
- Enforce code reviews by requiring merge requests.

---

## 5. Merge Strategies
GitLab supports different merge strategies to integrate changes:

### **Fast-Forward Merge**
- Integrates the feature branch without creating a merge commit.
- Example:
  ```bash
  git merge --ff-only feature/add-login
  ```

### **Merge Commit**
- Creates a merge commit to track the integration.
- Default strategy in GitLab.

### **Rebase and Merge**
- Rewrites commit history for a cleaner linear history.
- Example:
  ```bash
  git rebase main
  ```

### Configuring Merge Strategies:
- Go to **Settings > General > Merge Request Settings**.
- Enable or disable the strategies.

---

## 6. Branch Rules
Branch rules define specific behaviors for branches, such as required approvals or CI/CD rules.

### CI/CD Rules:
Control pipeline execution based on branch names.

#### Example:
```yaml
rules:
  - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"'
  - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH =~ /feature\/.*$/'
```

### Approval Rules:
Require approvals for specific branches in merge requests.

#### Configuring Approval Rules:
1. Go to **Settings > General > Merge Request Approvals**.
2. Define rules for specific branches.

---

By understanding and implementing these branching concepts, teams can establish robust workflows, minimize conflicts, and ensure code quality across all stages of development.

# Use Cases of Default Variables in GitLab

GitLab CI/CD provides default environment variables that are predefined for each pipeline run. These variables are accessible in `.gitlab-ci.yml` and are useful for customizing and automating pipeline behavior.

---

## Table of Contents
1. [What are Default Variables?](#1-what-are-default-variables)
2. [Key Use Cases](#2-key-use-cases)
   - [Pipeline Metadata](#21-pipeline-metadata)
   - [Branch-Specific Behavior](#22-branch-specific-behavior)
   - [Dynamic Job Names](#23-dynamic-job-names)
   - [Conditional Execution](#24-conditional-execution)
   - [Triggering Downstream Pipelines](#25-triggering-downstream-pipelines)
3. [Example Configuration](#3-example-configuration)
4. [Common Default Variables](#4-common-default-variables)

---

## 1. What are Default Variables?
Default variables are environment variables automatically set by GitLab during pipeline execution. These variables provide context about the repository, branch, commit, job, and pipeline.

### Example Variables:
- `$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH`: The branch name of the pipeline.
- `$CI_JOB_NAME`: The name of the running job.
- `$CI_PROJECT_PATH`: The path of the project.
- `$CI_PIPELINE_ID`: The unique ID of the pipeline.

---

## 2. Key Use Cases

### 2.1. Pipeline Metadata
Default variables provide metadata about the pipeline, which can be used for logging, artifact naming, or debugging.

#### Example:
```yaml
stages:
  - build

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Pipeline ID: $CI_PIPELINE_ID"
    - echo "Commit SHA: $CI_COMMIT_SHA"
```
#### Use Case:
- Log pipeline information for debugging or auditing.
- Name build artifacts with unique pipeline identifiers.

---

### 2.2. Branch-Specific Behavior
Execute jobs conditionally based on the branch being built.

#### Example:
```yaml
stages:
  - deploy

deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - if [ "$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH" = "main" ]; then echo "Deploying to production"; fi
    - if [ "$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH" != "main" ]; then echo "Skipping deployment"; fi
```
#### Use Case:
- Deploy code only for specific branches (e.g., `main`, `staging`).
- Trigger different behaviors for feature branches.

---

### 2.3. Dynamic Job Names
Create dynamic job names or messages based on variables.

#### Example:
```yaml
stages:
  - test

test-job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests for branch: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH"
```
#### Use Case:
- Provide meaningful logs for better traceability.
- Adapt job names/messages to current context.

---

### 2.4. Conditional Execution
Run specific scripts or commands based on variable values.

#### Example:
```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - deploy

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - if [ "$CI_PROJECT_PATH" = "group/project" ]; then echo "Building project"; fi
```
#### Use Case:
- Customize behavior based on the project, branch, or environment.
- Skip jobs for specific conditions.

---

### 2.5. Triggering Downstream Pipelines
Use variables to pass pipeline context to downstream projects.

#### Example:
```yaml
stages:
  - trigger

trigger-downstream:
  stage: trigger
  trigger:
    project: group/another-project
    branch: "$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH"
```
#### Use Case:
- Propagate branch or commit details to downstream pipelines.
- Automate multi-repository workflows.

---

## 3. Example Configuration
Hereâ€™s a full example that demonstrates the use of default variables:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building project: $CI_PROJECT_NAME"
    - echo "Running on branch: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH"

test-job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Testing commit: $CI_COMMIT_SHA"
    - echo "Pipeline URL: $CI_PIPELINE_URL"

deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - if [ "$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH" = "main" ]; then echo "Deploying to production"; fi
    - if [ "$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH" != "main" ]; then echo "Skipping deployment"; fi
```

---

## 4. Common Default Variables
Here are some commonly used default variables and their purposes:

| **Variable**              | **Description**                            |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH`       | Name of the branch being built.            |
| `$CI_COMMIT_SHA`          | Commit SHA for the current pipeline.       |
| `$CI_JOB_NAME`            | Name of the running job.                   |
| `$CI_PIPELINE_ID`         | Unique ID of the pipeline.                 |
| `$CI_PROJECT_NAME`        | Name of the project.                       |
| `$CI_PROJECT_PATH`        | Path of the project, including namespace.  |
| `$CI_PIPELINE_URL`        | URL to view the pipeline in GitLab.        |
